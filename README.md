## Election Audit Summary
By changing the output names of this scipt, we can use it in any kind of election. For example, we can use it in team member elections, mall manager elections, national elections, school elections etc.
- In order to use it in nation wide elections, we can change the county names to state names and the output will generate state names instead. 
- We can also change county votes to customer votes, if we want to find out which product customers favor the most in a boutique shop. The result will generate the most popular product which recieves the most amount of votes from customers.
